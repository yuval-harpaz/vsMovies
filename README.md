this repository depends on my other repositories work-drafts, ft_BIU and SAM_BIU.
it also requires AFNI and was tested on Linux only (Ubuntu 64 bit).

note the download button. the mterials and scripts can be downloaded from there.
you are welcome to clone the repository instead for easy updates.

the code is open source under GPLv2 terms.
